\chapter{Robust Single-Cycle ECG Generation}\label{ch:radarODE}
This chapter is based on the high-SNR radar measurements that contain ample cardiac features and aim to realize the robust ECG recovery to resist inevitable noises (e.g., \gls{rbm} noise). Previous studies leverage the powerful fitting capability of the \gls{dnn} to model complex and non-linear projections from radar to ECG signal, but the inference results can be easily distorted under abrupt noises~\cite{chen2022contactless,zhao2024airecg,zhao2024mmarrhythmia}. In this chapter, the traditional DNN is integrated with \gls{ode} with prior morphological features that constrain the ECG recovery, and a signal model is also designed to explain the critical features in the transformation from radar to ECG signals. The proposed ODE-embedded deep learning model is validated on the dataset with RBM noise, and the recovered ECG pieces still show high fidelity even when the subtle cardiac features are ruined by the noises with large amplitude.

\section{Introduction}
In the recent research about cardiac monitoring, the emergence of commercial radar platforms with high operating frequency encourages researchers to extract fine-grained cardiac features (e.g., ECG and SCG) from the radar signal~\cite{zhang2023overview}. SCG signal is measured by the accelerometer mounted on the human chest to measure the mechanical vibrations produced by heartbeats, describing the fine-grained cardiac mechanical activities such as aortic/mitral valve opening/closing and isovolumetric contraction~\cite{cocconcelli2020high}. Although these vibrations are subtle, it is still reasonable to directly map the displacements detected by radar to each fine-grained cardiac mechanical activity using high-resolution radar as proved in~\cite{ha2020contactless}. However, radar-based SCG recovery is not widely investigated compared with ECG, because ECG provides more comprehensive information (e.g., atrial/ventricular depolarization~\cite{khairy2007clinical}) for clinical diagnosis.

To reconstruct ECG from radar signal, the most straightforward approach is to directly sense the variation in the scattered electromagnetic field through frequency shift of mm-wave response, and the ECG signal can then be decoupled from the scattered electromagnetic field based on the dynamic model in the form of partial differential equations deduced from cardiac electrophysiology (i.e., ionic concentration in cardiac cells)~\cite{xu2021cardiacwave}. However, the solutions of the entire model are extremely hard to obtain either numerically or analytically, and the constructed models will be changed with respect to different environments and noises due to the Green's function~\cite{li2019intelligent}, causing difficulty in adapting the model in various real-life scenarios. 

The second approach, which is also the most adopted approach, only uses radar to sense the chest region displacement through the reflected radar signal as in coarse cardiac monitoring, but then the researchers must deal with domain decoupling to transform the measured signal from the mechanical domain to the electrical domain to generate ECG measurement. Intuitively, it is reasonable that mechanical conduction and electrical conduction are highly correlated in describing cardiac activities because the electrical changes in cells trigger heart muscle contraction, whereas such a relationship is called excitation-contraction coupling in electrophysiology and is extremely hard to interpret or model by researchers without biological knowledge~\cite{swift2021stop,orkand1964heart}.

In the literature, the existing studies all leverage deep learning methods to extract latent information from enormous radar/ECG pairs and try to learn domain transformation relying on the extraordinary non-linear mapping ability of the deep neural network~\cite{chen2022contactless,wu2023contactless,li2024radarnet,wang2023ecg,zhao2024airecg}. Although these studies could successfully reconstruct the ECG signal from radar, three drawbacks still need to be improved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no existing signal model with a compact form to describe the domain transformation for radar-based ECG reconstruction.
    \item The purely data-driven method could learn the domain transformation as a black box, but researchers can hardly intervene in the learning process to enhance the characteristic peaks of ECG or explain the intrinsic correspondence in domain transformation.
    \item The well-trained deep learning model is not robust to abrupt noises such as body movement~\cite{chen2022contactless,wang2023vital}, because these noises normally have orders of magnitude higher than cardiac-related vibrations, drowning out subtle features and ruining forward propagation of the deep neural network~\cite{wang2023slprof}.
\end{itemize}

Inspired by the above discussions, this chapter aims to design a framework for radar-based ECG reconstruction with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) embedded to provide prior knowledge on domain transformation and resist abrupt noises. The contributions of this research can be concluded as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This study proposes an ODE-embedded framework called radarODE to produce robust long-term ECG recovery against abrupt noises with the aid of morphological ECG features as the reference.
    \item A signal model is designed to describe the fine-grained cardiac feature sensed by radar, enabling further domain transformation between cardiac mechanical and electrical activities, instead of using purely data-driven approaches without any explanation as in the literature.
    \item Based on the proposed signal model, an ODE-embedded module called \gls{sceg} is designed to realize the domain transformation by parameterizing the radar signal into sparse representations and hence generate the morphological ECG features as references to resist noise.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:odemethod} explains the proposed model for radar signal and the structure of radarODE framework. Section~\ref{sec:odeexp} and~\ref{sec:odedataset} introduce the public dataset used for validation in this research and then present the results obtained with corresponding comparisons and evaluations. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:odeconclusions} concludes this chapter. 

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:odemethod}
\subsection{Overview}

    \label{fig:radarODE} 
\end{figure*}
In order to realize a robust radar-to-ECG reconstruction, the proposed radarODE framework is designed based on the domain transformation within a single cardiac cycle to generate faithful ECG reference that aids the domain transformation in long-term ECG recovery. The inputs of radarODE are $50$ synchronous radar signals that represent the measurements from $50$ spatial points within the chest region~\cite{chen2022contactless}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}, and the entire domain transformation is realized by three modules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first module estimates the \gls{ppi} for consecutive heartbeats based on the proposed peak detection algorithm and provides information for single cardiac cycle segmentation, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}(a).
    \item The second module first transforms the time-domain radar signal within a single cardiac cycle into a spectrogram using \gls{sst}. Then, the temporal and ODE decoder within SCEG will generate the faithful ECG pieces as morphological references while resisting noise disruption, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}(b).
    \item The third module is used to fuse the extracted morphological and temporal features hidden in the original radar signal to generate the final ECG recovery, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}(c).
\end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Model for Radar Signal and Pre-Processing}
\subsubsection{Fine-Grained Model for Radar Signal}
According to the literature in Chapter~\ref{ch:LR}, the chest displacement $x(t)$ can be further decomposed as
\begin{equation}
x(t) = x_c(t) + x_r(t) + x_n(t)
\end{equation}
where $x_c(t)$ means cardiac mechanical activities, $x_r(t)$ is respiration induced displacement and $x_n(t)$ is noise term. After the pre-processing, the respiration term has been filtered out, and the actual radar signal $\tilde{x}(t)$ provided in the dataset~\cite{chen2022contactless} can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}(t) = x_c(t) + x_n(t)
\end{equation}

Furthermore, the pre-processed radar signal $\tilde{x}(t)$ has two prominent vibrations $v_1$ and $v_2$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scg_ecg}, corresponding to the fine-grained cardiac mechanical activities shown in SCG. According to the previous work on SCG modeling, the heart muscle contraction has a pulsatile nature, and the bones/tissues in chest area introduce the extra damping into the pulse~\cite{nosrati2018accurate}. Inspired by the natural characteristics, the radar signal with two prominent vibrations measured in a single cardiac cycle is innovatively modeled as the Gaussian pulses with certain central frequencies as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:vib}
\tilde{x}(t) = v_1(t) + v_2(t) + x_n(t)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 v_1 &= \mathrm{a}_1 \mathrm{cos}(2\pi f_1 t)\exp \left(-\frac{(t-T_1)^2}{{b_1}^2}\right)\\
v_2 &= \mathrm{a}_2 \mathrm{cos}(2\pi f_2 t) \exp \left(-\frac{(t-T_2)^2}{{b_1}^2}\right)
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $a_1$, $b_1$ and $a_2$, $b_2$ jointly contribute to the amplitudes and length of the first and second prominent vibrations, $f_1$, $f_2$ are the corresponding central frequencies, $T_1$, $T_2$ determine when the vibrations happen, and $x_{n}(t)$ represents all the noises. 

The aim of proposing the model in (\ref{equ:vib}) is not to perform the curve fitting but to provide the explanation for the later radarODE design, because the positions of the prominent vibrations ($T_1$, $T_2$) are crucial to the precise reconstruction of ECG peaks using deep neural network.

\subsubsection{Signal Pre-Processing with Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform (SST)}
Based on the proposed radar signal model in (\ref{equ:vib}), the next step is to enhance the prominent vibrations (i.e., $T_1$, $T_2$). Figure~\ref{fig:scg_ecg} shows that the high SNR radar signal could reveal prominent peaks of $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the time domain, but in most cases, these two peaks (especially $v_2$) could be ruined by noise. Therefore, this research decides to extract the time-frequency domain information from the spectrogram obtained by synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST)~\cite{daubechies2011synchrosqueezed}, and the two vibrations can then be localized by the SCEG module proposed later in Section~\ref{sec:sceg}. 

SST evolves from \gls{cwt} but with concentrated energy distribution along the frequency axis, providing a sparser time-frequency representation with enhanced prominent vibrations compared with other tools such as \gls{stft} and CWT.

The first step of SST is to calculate the CWT of radar signal $\tilde{x}(t)$ as
\begin{equation}
W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)=\int \tilde{x}(t) a^{-1 / 2} \psi^*\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) d t
\end{equation}
where $\psi^*$ is the complex conjugate of the chosen mother wavelet, and $a$, $b$ are the adjustable scaling and translation factors for the wavelet $\psi$ to extract frequency- and time-domain information, respectively. In this research, the Morlet wavelet is selected as mother wavelet because it is widely used for vibration signal processing, especially for time-frequency localization~\cite{xue2023novel}.

The second step is to calculate the candidate instantaneous frequency for $W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)\neq 0$ as
\begin{equation}
f_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)=-2\pi i\left(W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)\right)^{-1} \frac{\partial W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)}{\partial b}
\end{equation}

The final step is to concentrate the energy along the candidate instantaneous frequency as
\begin{equation}
T_{\tilde{x}}(2\pi f, b)=\int_{A(b)} W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b) a^{-3 / 2} \delta\left(2\pi f_{\tilde{x}}(a, b)-2\pi f\right) d f
\end{equation}
where $A(b)=\left\{a ; W_{\tilde{x}}(a, b) \neq 0\right\}$, and $\delta$ represents the Dirac-delta function in a distribution version to smoothly squeeze the spread-out energy into a narrow band around the instantaneous frequency~\cite{daubechies2011synchrosqueezed}.

The quality of the resultant spectrograms can be evaluated using \gls{pse}~\cite{wang2023vital}, with a small value indicating that the energy is concentrated around a certain frequency. The calculated PSE for the spectrogram produced by STFT, CWT and SST is $0.94$, $0.90$ and $0.76$ respectively, with the visualized results shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:compare_stft},~\subref*{fig:compare_cwt} and~\subref*{fig:compare_sst}. It is clear that the spectrogram obtained by STFT only shows the rough positions of each $v_1$, while CWT gives a sharp position for both vibrations, but the energy is still spread out. By further concentrating the energy distribution, SST produces the spectrogram with a relatively clean background and sharp peaks for the vibrations, reducing the burden of the deep-learning-based SCEG module in extracting latent features (i.e., $T_1$, $T_2$).

\subsection{radarODE Framework Design}
\subsubsection{Single-cycle ECG Length Estimation}
The first module of radarODE aims to estimate the length of each single-cycle ECG piece by calculating the interval between two consecutive heartbeats (i.e., PPI) from the energy plots $\hat{x}$ of the radar signal $\tilde{x}$ (omit $(t)$ for simplicity) as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:correct_detection}. The energy plot is obtained by simply adding the spectrogram along frequency axis, but the peak detection results may not be promising due to low SNR signals as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:wrong_detection}. Therefore, a new algorithm is proposed as in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi} to eliminate the wrong detection obtained from $50$ radar energy plots ${X}_{\mathcal{L}}$, with the length of each $\hat{x}_{i}\in {X}_{\mathcal{L}}$ equal to $l$.

The design of Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi} is based on the fact that the PPI for healthy people tends to be unchanged in adjacent cardiac cycles. In this case, the long-term radar energy plots are firstly sliced into short segments as shown in the \textsc{Initialization} stage in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi}, and then the biopeaks algorithm implemented in NeuroKit2~\cite{makowski2021neurokit2} is used for detecting all the potential peaks $P$ from each energy plot segment $\hat{x}^j_i$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:biopeak}
P = biopeaks(\hat{x}^j_i)
\end{equation}
Secondly, the resultant $PPI_\mathcal{C}$ obtained from Line~\ref{line:biopeaks}-\ref{line:update} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi} contains potential estimated PPI from $50$ radar energy plots, with the correct estimations as the majority. Therefore, the \gls{kde}~\cite{terrell1992variable} is applied on the candidate set $PPI_\mathcal{C}$ to calculate the probability density of different PPI values as:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:kde}
KDE:\ \hat{f}(p)=\frac{1}{n h} \sum_{c=1}^n K\left(\frac{p-PPI_{c\in \mathcal{C}}}{h}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{f}(p)$ means the estimated probability density function at point $p$, $n$ is the number of all the estimated PPI in $PPI_\mathcal{C}$, $K$ is the Gaussian kernel function and $h=n^{-1 /5}$ is the bandwidth of the kernel. Lastly, the final PPI for the current segment is selected as the argument $p$ when $\hat{f}(p)$ achieves the maximum as in Line~\ref{line:final} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi}, and the long-term PPI estimation can be obtained step by step as Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi} terminated.

\end{algorithmic} 
\end{algorithm} 

\subsubsection{Single-cycle ECG Generator (SCEG)}\label{sec:sceg}
Based on the yielded $PPI$, the SST spectrogram can be sliced into segments corresponding to a single cardiac cycle, and the aim of the SCEG module is to reconstruct the ECG for each single cardiac cycle, hence realizing the transformation from mechanical to electrical domain. In general, the input of the SCEG is $N$ segments of the SST plot within $[1,25]$~Hz with the size of $F\times T$ on frequency and time axis, and the output is the corresponding $N$ ECG pieces with the same length $T$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sceg}. In practice, the deep neural network only accepts the inputs/outputs of the same size. Therefore, the actual SST segment is centered at the current cardiac cycle and expands to $4$ seconds, and the corresponding ECG ground truth is resampled to a fixed length of $200$ for loss calculation.

For architecture design, the SCEG module adopts the popular backbone-encoder-decoder structure as verified by enormous image-related tasks~\cite{li2023euclidean,chu2024vessel}, with detailed parameters shown in Table~\ref{tab:param}. In addition, a feature fusion block is added after the decoder to fuse the temporal and morphological features and generate the final ECG reconstructions. The detailed implementation of each part in Table~\ref{tab:param} with explanations can be elaborated as:

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item \textbf{Backbone: } Backbone is typically used as the first block to extract both low-level (e.g., color, edge) and high-level features (e.g., presence of specific pattern) from the input images. In the context of this research, the backbone is expected to localize the vibrations $v_1$, $v_2$ revealed as periodically appeared bright triangles within the range of $[1,25]~Hz$ on SST plots, providing latent information of $T_1$, $T_2$ for the further ECG reconstruction. 

\quad According to the literature, ResNet with residual blocks is widely used as the backbone for feature extraction in many fields~\cite{chen2024tfpred}, and this research will use a similar structure with $4$ layers of residual blocks and downsample blocks as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:backbone}, with the key parameters listed in Table~\ref{tab:param}. In addition, the traditional 2D convolution is all replaced by deformable 2D convolution~\cite{dai2017deformable} with deformable kernels (instead of square kernels) to fit the irregular shape of the target patterns, as shown in red triangles in Figure~\ref{fig:sceg}.
\begin{figure}[tb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{backbone.eps}
    \caption{Structure of backbone composed of residual block and downsample block: DeformConv2d means deformable 2D convolution, BN is batch normalization, and ReLU is the rectified linear unit activation function.} 
    \label{fig:backbone} 
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Squeezer and Encoder: } The output feature map from the backbone should involve both frequency- and time-domain features, and the squeezer is simply used to squeeze the frequency-domain feature using 2D convolution (Conv2d) and output the feature map with the temporal feature only. Then, the encoder assembled by three 1D transposed convolution (Transconv1d) blocks is used to further extract the temporal feature, with each block comprising Transconv1d, BN and ReLU. Finally, the output feature map from the encoder should contain latent information about $v_1$, $v_2$ (i.e., ($T_1$, $T_2$)).

\item \textbf{ECG Feature Decoder: }The decoder is an essential part of SCEG to extract the temporal and morphological features separately from the latent information in the SST feature map, as shown in two branches in Figure~\ref{fig:sceg}. At first, an initial decoder is shared by the latter two decoders and comprises four 1D convolution (Conv1d) blocks with Conv1d, BN, and ReLU inside. Similarly, the temporal feature decoder is assembled by three Conv1d, and the output feature should contain prominent peaks at the position of $T_1$, $T_2$. However, these two peaks may still have deviations from the peaks in ECG ground truth, because obviously the mechanical vibrations $v_1$, $v_2$ lag behind QRS-complex and T-peaks, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scg_ecg}. Another problem with the temporal feature decoder is that the ECG pieces have an entirely different shape with radar measurements, and the decoder needs to `memorize' the unique pattern of ECG. Although the previous work shows the deep neural network could learn the patterns after training, the whole process of ECG reconstruction lacks supervision and is vulnerable to noise in radar signals~\cite{chen2022contactless,yang2022pipeline}.

In this case, the ODE decoder is designed as a branch to assist the transformation between cardiac mechanical and electrical activities. The main obstacles in modeling such domain transformation are the lack of (a) A compact model for ECG signal and (b) A corresponding explanation between parameters in describing radar signal and ECG signal, e.g., what is the relationship between R peak and $v_1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:scg_ecg}. In this work, the aforementioned two obstacles can be solved from the following perspectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The shape of the ECG piece can be modeled morphologically using ODEs in a compact form without any biological/chemical knowledge~\cite{mcsharry2003dynamical}.
    \item The measurements of mechanical activities generally lag behind those of electrical activities with a short time delay $\tau$~\cite{swift2021stop,orkand1964heart}.
\end{itemize}

\quad Inspired by the above facts, the ODE decoder is designed as a parameter estimation part and an ODE solver as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sceg}, and the solution of the ODEs will be shifted to the left with time $\tau$. In this manner, the latent information in describing radar signals is first transformed to the parameters for the ECG signal, and then the ODE solver will generate morphological-prior to accelerate the convergence of the model training process and provide extra robustness against noises.

\quad To be specific, the parameters estimation part contains four linear blocks (Linear Layer, BN, Tanh) to project the latent space yielded by the initial decoder into parameters $\eta$, $\tau$, and $\eta$ will be sent to an ODE solver to solve a 3D trajectory denoted by $(x,\ y,\ z)$ as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:ode}
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    & \frac{d x}{d t}=\alpha(x, y) x-\omega y \\
    & \frac{d y}{d t}=\alpha(x, y) y+\omega x \\
    & \frac{d z}{d t}=-\sum_{e_f\in \mathcal{F}} a_{e_f} \Delta \theta_{e_f}(x, y) e^{-\Delta \theta_{e_f}(x, y)^2 / 2 b_{e_f}^2}-z
    \end{aligned}
    \right. 
\end{equation}
    with
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \alpha(x, y) & =1-\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\
    \Delta \theta_{e_f}(x, y) & =\left(\theta(x, y)-\theta_{e_f}\right) \quad \bmod 2 \pi \\
    \theta(x, y) & =\operatorname{atan} 2(y, x)) \in[-\pi, \pi] \\
    e_f\in\mathcal{F} & =\{e_P, e_Q, e_R, e_S, e_T\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{F}$ represents five characteristic peaks (PQRST) in a single-cycle ECG signal, and the whole ODEs can be interpreted as manipulating each peak along a unit circle by varying the value of $\eta=\{a_{e_f},b_{e_f},\theta_{e_f}\}$ to adjust corresponding amplitude, width and position of each peak. After specifying all $15$ parameters $\eta$ ($3$ for each peak) and the initial conditions of $(x,y,z)$, the value of $z$ can be solved by the ODE solver using the Euler method to get the final single-cycle ECG signal as the morphological feature. In practice, the default values for $\eta$ are provided in advance as in Table~\ref{tab:ode_value}, and the estimated parameters within the range of $[-1,1]$ are used to scale the default values.

\item \textbf{Feature Fusion: } The feature fusion module could leverage respective advantages of the morphological and temporal features and generate the final ECG signal for loss calculation, because the morphological feature only focuses on five peaks to provide a rough shape of ECG with calibrated peaks, and the temporal feature reserves all the other feature neglected in (\ref{equ:ode}) to help the final reconstruction~\cite{guan2023achelous}. Therefore, two features are first fused together by multiplication (Mul.) into one and then stacked four times by itself. Then, the stacked feature is encoded and decoded as in Table~\ref{tab:param} to produce the final single-cycle ECG piece.
\end{enumerate}

The last step of SCEG is to resample all the ECG pieces generated after the feature fusion part with respect to the previous PPI estimation, and the resampled ECG pieces are concatenated in a time sequence to form the final morphological reference for long-term ECG reconstruction.

\subsubsection{Long-Term ECG Reconstruction}
The long-term ECG reconstruction network adopts a similar encoder-decoder-fusion structure with SCEG as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}(c), with the detailed structure and parameters shown in Table~\ref{tab:long_structure} and Figure~\ref{fig:tcn_net}. The encoder takes $50$ series of 4-sec time-domain radar signals as input and is composed of three groups of residual and downsample blocks with the deformable 2D convolution in Figure~\ref{fig:backbone} replaced by 1D convolution. Then, the decoder is realized by three Transconv1d blocks to generate the temporal feature.

The temporal feature generated from decoder in Table~\ref{tab:long_structure} will be stacked with morphological feature as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}(c), and these two features act as two channels for later feature fusion by the \gls{tcn}. In general, TCN adopts dilation 1D convolution (Dilated Conv1d) to process multi-channel data structure using expanded receptive field with gaps between elements as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tcn_net}, and the feature fusion is achieved during channel reduction as a common technique in traditional convolution neural network~\cite{xue2023novel}. Specifically, the solid line in Figure~\ref{fig:tcn_net} shows the connection of a $4$-layer TCN with the gaps for each layer $l$ as $d=D^{l-1}-1$, and the output $y_T$ is predicted based on a receptive field of $15$ input feature points $\{a_{T-14},\dots,a_T\}$. In this chapter, $9$-layer Dilated Conv1d is adopted with dilation factor $D=2$ and kernel size $K=3$, and the receptive field is $511$ to make the most of contextual information contained in the temporal and morphological features.

\section{Dataset and Implementation Details}\label{sec:odedataset}
\subsection{Hardware and Environment Settings for Data Collection}
The public dataset can be requested from~\cite{chen2022contactless} and is collected by the TI AWR-1843 radar with $77$~GHz start frequency and $3.8$~GHz bandwidth, providing good SNR and resolution to detect subtle vibrations that fit the proposed signal model and framework. To realize the 3D beamforming to extract cardiac features from real 3D space, $3$ transmitters (Tx) and $4$ receivers (Rx) are enabled with \gls{tdmmimo} applied in chirp transmitting and receiving.

The data collection is performed for subjects lying on the bed with quasi-static status to ensure good SNR with the least RBM noise. In addition, radar is placed right above the human chest region in a range of $0.4-0.5$m with minor propagation attenuation as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:env_set}, and hence the large- or small-scale signal variations (e.g., path loss, multi-path fading) are not considered in~\cite{chen2022contactless}.

\begin{figure}[tb] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{env_set.eps}
    \caption{Environment settings for data collection from quasi-static subject~\cite{chen2022contactless}.}
    \label{fig:env_set} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Link Budget Analysis}
Link budget analysis is a common evaluation for the performance of a radar system by accounting for all gains and losses from the transmitter to the receiver~\cite{mercuri2019vital,lin2022broadband}, but such analysis is not provided in~\cite{chen2022contactless}. For a radar system, the received power $P_{\mathrm{R}}$ can be expressed with respect to the transmitted power $P_{\mathrm{T}}$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:proga}
P_{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{G_{\mathrm{T}} G_{\mathrm{R}} \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4 \pi)^3 R^4} P_{\mathrm{T}}
\end{equation}
where $G_T$/$G_R$ is the gain of the transmitter/receiver, $\sigma$ is the effective radar cross section (RCS) for the human chest region, and $R$ is the distance between radar and chest~\cite{mercuri2019vital}.

In addition, the lowest detectable signal power of the receiver is defined in~\cite{lin2022broadband} as:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:p_desire}
P_{\mathrm{r}, \min}= -174\ \mathrm{dBm} + 10\log_{10}(B) + \mathrm{NF} + \mathrm{SNR}_{\min}
\end{equation}
where $-174$ represents the thermal-noise level, NF means the noise figure, $B$ is the bandwidth of the receiver and $\mathrm{SNR}_{\min}$ is the desired SNR considering the afterward signal processing.

By combining (\ref{equ:proga}) and (\ref{equ:p_desire}), the maximum detectable range can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:r_max}
R_{\text {max}}=\sqrt[4]{\frac{G_{\mathrm{T}} G_{\mathrm{R}} \lambda^2 \sigma P_{\mathrm{T}}}{(4 \pi)^3 \ P_{\mathrm{r}, \min}}}
\end{equation}

All the radar-related values in (\ref{equ:r_max}) are shown in Table~\ref{tab:link_param} according to the datasheet of TI AWR-1843 radar~\cite{AWR1843}. According to the previous work~\cite{lin2022broadband,chen2022contactless}, the RCS value can be estimated as $-20$ dBsm for the quasi-static subjects wearing electrically thin cloth (i.e., the thickness is much smaller than the wavelength), with respiration noise filtered during the pre-processing stage. After substituting the values, the lowest detectable signal power is $P_{\mathrm{r}, \min}=-53$ dBm, and the maximum detectable range is $R_{\text {max}}=4$ m, revealing that the parameter setting used in~\cite{chen2022contactless} could provide the received signal with good SNR.

\end{table}%

\subsection{Dataset Description}
Half of the actual dataset is released with $91$ trials for $11$ subjects (with subject ID 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 29, 30), and each trial contains $3$ minutes of data (radar measurements and ECG ground truth) with $200$~Hz sampling rate collected under $4$ physiological statuses (i.e., normal breath (NB, $43$ trials), irregular breath (IB, $18$ trials), sleep (SP, $18$ trials) and post exercise (PE, $12$ trials)). In addition, the work in~\cite{chen2022contactless} has pre-processed the radar signal using several techniques, such as 3D beamforming, dynamic time wrapping, to remove respiration noise and enhance cardiac activities. Lastly, no existing study is found for ECG reconstruction in literature based on the same dataset, and the proposed framework MMECG in~\cite{chen2022contactless} will be used as the only benchmark to make a comparison with our radarODE.

\subsection{Implementation Details and Compared Frameworks}
The proposed radarODE network is coded using PyTorch and trained for $200$ epochs with batch size $32$ on the NVIDIA RTX A4000 ($16$~GB) using stochastic gradient descent optimizer with early stop function~\cite{yao2007early} and learning rate $0.001$ based on a cosine annealing schedule~\cite{loshchilov2016sgdr}. The dataset is split into training and testing sets based on $11$-fold cross-validation with $1$ fixed subject for testing and the other $10$ subjects alternatively selected for training or validation, ensuring to make the most of all the trials while excluding the testing data from the training phase. In addition, all the ground truth characteristic peaks, PPI, and cardiac cycles are obtained by the NeuroKit2 from ECG signals~\cite{makowski2021neurokit2}. Furthermore, the $4$-seconds-long input SST segments only contain the frequency component within $[1,25]$~Hz and are down-sampled to $30$~Hz in the time-axis for saving memory usage in backbone design. 

In addition, three frameworks are selected for comparison with the following brief introduction of the architecture:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MMECG~\cite{chen2022contactless} receives multiple 1D radar signals as input and utilizes Conv1d and Transformer as decoder to simultaneously extract temporal and spatial features. The encoded features are further fused by multiplication and then decoded by Transconv1d and TCN to produce ECG recovery. 
  \item RSSRNet~\cite{wu2023contactless} takes spectrogram (STFT) as input with a Conv2d backbone and Transformer encoder. The adopted decoder is Transconv2d, and the output is still a spectrogram and needs to be converted to the ECG signal via inverse STFT.
  \item RadarNet~\cite{li2024radarnet} adopts 1D radar signal as input and directly generates coarse ECG signal using Conv1d. Then, several layers of ResNet are adopted to refine the ECG waveform.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results and Evaluations}\label{sec:odeexp}
This section provides the experimental results and evaluations in terms of three core modules as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:radarODE}, with the first module providing PPI estimation for input/output slicing and reshaping, the second module robustly generating ECG pieces for the single cardiac cycle, and the third module yielding the final long-term ECG recovery.

\subsection{Evaluations of PPI Estimation} \label{sec:ppi}
The PPI estimation is the first module of radarODE, and the accuracy of the estimated PPI directly affects the fidelity of the concatenated morphological reference. Therefore, Figure~\subref*{fig:ppi_obj} shows the PPI estimation error obtained by Algorithm~\ref{alg:ppi} for all subjects based on KDE defined in (\ref{equ:kde}) or directly averaging the candidate PPI values. The large PPI error (e.g., for subject $13$, $17$) is normally caused by body movements or residual respiration noise due to IB or PE status, as also shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:ppi_phy} with large median error and variation for both methods. In contrast, the subjects in NB and SP statuses tend to be stable with less body movement, and the respiration noise can be well eliminated, achieving low median PPI errors as $0.03$s and $0.02$s using the KDE-based method for each status.

Overall, it is clear that the KDE-based PPI estimation is more accurate than the mean-based estimation for each subject, as shown in the \gls{cdf} in Figure~\subref*{fig:ppi_cdf}, because the KDE-based method is robust to the outliers caused by noises and could figure out the correct PPI estimation near the majority of candidate values.

  \label{fig:sceg_performance}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Evaluations of SCEG Module in radarODE}
SCEG is the core module that realizes the domain transformation and ensures the robust long-term ECG recovery in the next stage, and the performance is evaluated on the generated single-cycle ECG pieces in terms of morphological accuracy, corrupt ECG reconstruction and absolute R-peak error as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sceg_performance} and Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.

\subsubsection{Comparison of Morphological Accuracy}
The morphological accuracy is shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} as the median value of \gls{rmse} and \gls{pcc}, with RMSE sensitive to the deviation of peaks and PCC focusing on the general shape. The overall performances for all trials are shown as CDF plots in Figure~\subref*{fig:rmse_cdf_compare} and~\subref*{fig:sceg_cor_cdf}. The results indicate that radarODE could generate high-fidelity ECG signals with good RMSE and PCC owing to the prior knowledge provided by the ODE decoder, while MMECG achieves the second-best result and shows a domain transformation ability for the majority of radar inputs with good SNR. In contrast, RSSRNet and RadarNet achieve a similar performance because they only accept single-channel inputs and cannot effectively leverage the features of $50$ channels provided in the dataset.

\subsubsection{Comparison of Corrupt ECG Recovery}
The ability to recover ECG pieces from corrupt radar signals reveals the noise robustness of each framework, and \gls{mdr} is adopted to count failed recoveries without showing characteristic ECG patterns (R peaks). Three rules are made to define the failed ECG recoveries:
\begin{itemize}
\item The deviation of the corrupt R peak from the ground truth exceeds the absolute tolerance of $0.15$s~\cite{chen2022contactless}.
\item The corrupt R peak has one or more neighboring R peaks closer than $0.3$s.
\item The amplitude of the corrupt R peak is $30\%$ lower than that of the ground truth R peak.
\end{itemize}

The results of MDR are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} with CDF plots of all trials shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:MDR_cdf_overall}. It is evident that radarODE achieves better noise robustness compared with previous work, owing to the constraint brought by ODE decoder. MMECG still has a better performance compared with RSSRNet and RadarNet due to the powerful backbone to extract features from undistorted channels. The overall performance of MDR in Figure~\subref*{fig:MDR_cdf_overall} coincides with the morphological accuracy in Figure~\subref*{fig:rmse_cdf_compare} and~\subref*{fig:sceg_cor_cdf}, because the corrupt ECG recoveries also significantly affect the RMSE and PCC.

\subsubsection{Comparison of R-peak Timing Error}
After filtering the corrupt ECG pieces, the absolute timing error of R peaks is calculated to evaluate the quality of fine-grained ECG features, with the median value and CDF plots shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Figure~\subref*{fig:sceg_r_cdf} respectively. The results are still similar to previous evaluations, with radarODE recovering the most accurate R peaks and the other three frameworks showing larger R-peak deviation. In addition to the benefits brought by ODE decoder, the adopted SST inputs also provide necessary time-frequency features to help the deep learning model identify indistinctive vibrations under low-SNR scenarios.

\subsubsection{Ablation Study} 
The ablation study is performed to further evaluate the contributions of temporal and ODE decoders. The results in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} reveal that both decoders can work individually and achieve reasonable results, but the ODE decoder has lower accuracy because it neglects the subtle ECG feature while only focusing on the characteristic peaks with rigid connections elsewhere, as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:ode_sceg}. On the contrary, the introduced ODE model could resist strong noise and achieve the lowest MDR as $0.14\%$, while the temporal decoder only gets a similar MDR ($1.53\%$) with MMECG ($1.24\%$). In radarODE, the outputs of temporal and ODE decoder are fused together to achieve noise robustness with MDR$=0.18\%$, while maintaining a faithful ECG shape (i.e., good RMSE and PCC).

\subsubsection{Visualization of Training Process} 
Figure~\subref*{fig:loss_compare} illustrates the training loss for benchmark and ablation study with the dotted line representing the early stop of the training process and the shaded area indicating the repetition of the training process for five times. From the ablation study, SCEG with only ODE decoder cannot provide a very accurate reconstruction due to the rigid shape as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:ode_sceg}, while the temporal decode could achieve the second-best result. After combining ODE and temporal decoders, the outputs from ODE decoder act as the morphological-prior to accelerate the convergence, achieving the RMSE of $0.17$mV after the first epoch. In addition, the morphological reference will not be destroyed by noises and could stabilize the training process, contributing to the lowest training loss as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:loss_compare}.

\subsubsection{Summary of SCEG Evaluation} 
The proposed SCEG module in radarODE achieves better accuracy in generating single-cycle ECG pieces with the improvements brought by the ODE decoder and SST inputs, enabling successful recoveries even under abrupt noises and achieving the best RMSE, PCC and R-peak accuracy compared with previous frameworks. 

The generated ECG pieces can be resized and concatenated based on PPI estimation, but the PPI estimation error may accumulate and degrade the accuracy as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:sceg_good} and~\subref*{fig:sceg_bad}, because slight deviations of the peaks ruin the overall RMSE/PCC, hence requiring long-term reconstruction module to refine the concatenated ECG pieces in the next step. To provide a comprehensive evaluation for long-term ECG recovery from various dimensions (e.g., trials, subjects, and physical statuses), MMECG is selected as the only benchmark in the next section for a clear result visualization.

\subsection{Overall Evaluations of radarODE}\label{sec:overall_ode}
The long-term ECG reconstruction module finally generates 3-minute-long ECG signals for the evaluations of the entire radarODE framework in terms of corrupt ECG reconstruction, morphological accuracy, and fine-grained cardiac feature accuracy.

\subsubsection{Corrupt ECG Reconstruction} 
The ideal reconstructed ECG signals are shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:overall_ode} and~\subref*{fig:overall_mmecg} with corresponding RMSE/PCC labeled. However, the long-term ECG signal may contain corrupt parts due to the presence of body movements (especially in IB and PE). Figure~\subref*{fig:overall_noise} shows the corrupted ECG reconstruction yield by MMECG with the falsely detected R peaks noted as red dots, and Figure~\subref*{fig:overall_rcg} is the raw radar signal with extensive distortion induced by body movements. In contrast, the radarODE could still provide faithful ECG reconstructions under body movements due to the introduction of prior knowledge (ODE model) about ECG as the morphological reference, hence gaining certain robustness in resisting noises.

    \caption{Morphological accuracy comparison for different physical statuses: (a) and (b) RMSE and PCC under different physical statuses.}
    \label{fig:rmse_cor3}
\end{figure}

The overall MDR can be calculated from the recovered ECG signal with the CDF plot shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:detection_cdf_overall}, and the overall improvement achieved by radarODE is $9\%$. In addition, the CDF plots for different physical statuses are plotted in Figure~\subref*{fig:detection_cdf_phy} with the $90$-percentile MDR of $0.12\%$, $0.85\%$, $0.32\%$, $3.71\%$ during NB, IB, SP, PE for radarODE and $3.36\%$, $6.22\%$, $0.83\%$, $9.64\%$ for MMECG. The result shows that different physical statuses have noticeable impacts on the quality of the reconstructed long-term ECG, and radarODE could provide a lower MDR than MMECG in all statuses owing to the prior knowledge in the ODE decoder.

\subsubsection{Morphological Accuracy}
The morphological accuracy measures the similarity between reconstructed and ground truth ECG signals by calculating RMSE and PCC. Figure~\subref*{fig:rmse_cdf} and~\subref*{fig:cor_cdf} show the overall performance of radarODE and MMECG in CDF with the median RMSE and PCC of $0.097$mV$/89.6\%$ and $0.120$mV$/81.2\%$. It is worth noticing that the overall improvement of radarODE compared to MMECG is $16\%$ and $19\%$ for RMSE and PCC across $91$ trials respectively, indicating that the morphological-prior is more helpful in generalizing the typical ECG pattern than calibrating the peaks.

In addition, Figure~\subref*{fig:rmse_obj} and~\subref*{fig:cor_obj} illustrate the RMSE/PCC across all subjects, with radarODE always achieving better results than MMECG. It is worth noting that the results of the long-term reconstruction show certain consistency with the previous PPI estimation error, because the fidelity of the morphological reference is directly affected by the PPI error. For example, subjects $10$, $13$, $14$, and $30$ get worse results than others in either RMSE or PCC evaluation due to the large PPI estimation error as shown in Figure~\subref*{fig:ppi_obj}.

Lastly, Figure~\subref*{fig:rmse_phy} and~\subref*{fig:cor_phy} illustrate the RMSE/PCC for all trials in terms of different physical statuses, and the box plots show that the stable statuses (i.e., NB, SP) guarantee the reconstruction with small variance. In contrast, unstable statues (i.e., IB, PE) can severely ruin the radar signal due to body movements, causing an inconsistent quality of the reconstructed ECG. However, radarODE could still provide the reconstructions with a smaller variance than MMECG, especially for unstable statues because of the morphological-prior embedded in the ODE decoder.

  \label{fig:peak_compare2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fine-Grained Cardiac Events Reconstruction}
The evaluation of fine-grained cardiac features aims to analyze the timing accuracy of the QRST peaks and the P peak is not considered in this evaluation as also suggested in~\cite{chen2022contactless}, because the P peak is inconspicuous and even unable to be detected for some ground truth ECG signal. The overall result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:peak_cdf} as CDF with the median/$90$-percentile absolute timing error for QRST peaks shown in Table~\ref{tab:peak_acc}. The improvement owes to the use of SST spectrogram with more evident patterns for the prominent heart vibrations, and the ODE decoder contributes to calibrating the peak positions according to $\eta$ and $\tau$, hence improving the overall peak accuracy.

Figure~\subref*{fig:peak_phy_ode} and~\subref*{fig:peak_phy_mmecg} demonstrate the improvement of radarODE in terms of different physical statuses, and the results coincide with many previous evaluations. Firstly, the radarODE outperforms MMECG for all statuses with the R peak always achieving the best accuracy. Secondly, stable physical statuses tend to yield accurate reconstruction with small variance, but the difference between statues is smaller than that of the morphological accuracy analysis, because the corrupt reconstructions have been filtered for peak accuracy evaluation. 

\subsubsection{Summary of Long-term ECG Recovery Evaluation} 
The experimental results illustrated that the proposed radarODE could yield high-quality long-term ECG recovery even under extensive body movement noise, with better RMSE and PCC compared with the benchmark. In addition, the introduction of the SST spectrogram and the ODE decoder further improves the accuracy of the fine-grained cardiac features that are crucial to the potential applications in clinical diagnosis.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:odeconclusions}
Radar-based ECG reconstruction is highly reliant on purely data-driven approaches and lacks theoretical support regarding the transformation between mechanical activities measured by radar and electrical activities described as ECG. This research aims to bridge the gap to realize the transformation from the mechanical domain to the electrical domain by proposing the signal model with fine-grained features considered and further designing a deep learning framework radarODE with morphological prior embedding as ODEs. The radarODE framework is validated on the public dataset containing $4.5$ hours of radar measurements with corresponding ablation study and comparisons with the benchmark. The experimental result shows that radarODE could achieve a better MDR, morphological accuracy and peak accuracy than the benchmark, proving the rationality of the proposed signal model and the effectiveness of the radarODE under various physical statuses and random body movement.
